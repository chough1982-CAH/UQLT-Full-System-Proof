# Reproducibility Statement

This repository constitutes a complete, executable proof
of the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT).

All results are reproducible from this repository alone.

---

## Determinism

- No randomness is used unless explicitly logged
- No tuning parameters exist
- No initial conditions are hand-selected for success

Structure emerges only if the laws permit it.

---

## What Is Proven

Running the included scripts demonstrates:

1. Ordered state emergence without forces
2. Helium-driven collapse via illegal-state resolution
3. Core formation without gravity
4. EMN emission as a post-collapse effect
5. Valignity layering without attraction
6. Hover and neutral bands as density equilibria

---

## How to Reproduce

Run the following files in any order:

- `run_stage_chain.py`
- `run_collapse_engine.py`
- `run_emn_quantification.py`

If structure fails to emerge, the theory is falsified.

## Failure Policy

Failure is a valid outcome.

This engine does not guarantee success.
It guarantees honesty.
