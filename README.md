# UQLT-Full-System-Proof

This repository contains the **full executable proof engine** for Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT).

It demonstrates—by simulation and measured outputs—the complete causal chain:

**VOID → STATIC → RADIO → RADIANT → PLASMA → He-4 → (He-3 / D / T / H + heavy residues)  
→ HELIUM DOMINANCE → COLLAPSE → CORE → EMN OUTPUT  
→ CONTAINMENT ENVELOPE → VALIGNITY LAYERING  
→ HOVER / NEUTRAL BANDS → SURFACE EQUILIBRIUM**

This is not a conceptual model or visualization.  
It is a **law-complete, falsifiable proof engine**.

## What This Repository Proves

### 1. Stage-Chain Formation
- Ordered emergence from void states into structured states
- Helium formation is an emergent closure event, not a starting assumption
