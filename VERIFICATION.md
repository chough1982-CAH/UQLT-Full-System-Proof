# Verification Record

This repository verifies the Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT)
through executable, falsifiable simulation.

---

## Verification Method

The proof engine enforces:

- Discrete legal states only
- Hard energy limits
- Collapse triggered by forbidden states
- No forces, no gravity, no expansion
- No scripted outcomes

All structure emerges from constraint resolution alone.

---

## Verified Results

The following behaviors were observed and recorded:

- Ordered state progression from VOID through PLASMA
- Helium dominance as a non-negotiable collapse trigger
- Core formation without attraction or curvature
- EMN emission only after core stabilization
- Valignity layering as equilibrium positioning
- Neutral / hover bands as density boundaries

## Independent Validation

Any researcher may:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the provided scripts
3. Observe identical outcomes

If identical outcomes do not occur, the theory is falsified.

## Status
