# REPRODUCIBILITY — Determinism, Repeatability, and Falsifiability

This document defines how simulations in **UQLT-Full-System-Proof** guarantee
deterministic behavior, reproducible results, and falsifiable outcomes.

This repository is not exploratory.  
It is constructed so that **identical inputs produce identical outputs**, and
law violations produce **hard failure**, not reinterpretation.

---

## Deterministic Execution

All simulations in this repository support deterministic execution through:

- Fixed random seeds
- Fixed parameter sets
- Fixed update order
- Fixed state-transition rules

When the same simulation is run with the same configuration:
- Outputs must be identical
- Any deviation indicates a bug or law violation

---

## Random Seeds

All stochastic components are governed by an explicit seed.

Default behavior:
- A fixed seed is used unless explicitly overridden
- Seed values are logged and stored with outputs

This ensures:
- Exact replay of simulations
- Identical plots and metrics across machines

---

## Parameter Locking

Simulation parameters are defined in:
- `config/constants.py`
- `config/parameters.py`

Parameters are:
- Loaded at initialization
- Immutable during runtime
- Not permitted to change mid-simulation

Any attempt to mutate parameters during execution is illegal and halts the system.

---

## Update Order

Each simulation step follows a strict order:

1. Intake / emission calculations
2. Saturation checks
3. State transitions
4. Collapse enforcement
5. EMN propagation
6. Structural validation

Reordering these steps is not allowed.

---

## Output Guarantees

Each run produces:
- Raw numerical data (`outputs/data/`)
- Derived metrics
- Plots (`outputs/plots/`)

Outputs include:
- seed value
- parameter hash
- simulation identifier

This allows third parties to verify results independently.

---

## Falsifiability Conditions

A simulation is considered **falsified** if:

- A law in `LAW_INDEX.md` is violated
- Energy exceeds unit capacity without legal transition
- Collapse fails to occur when triggered
- EMN energy does not weaken outward
- Valignity ordering inverts
- Hover bands fail to stabilize
- Surface equilibrium does not emerge

Any of these conditions results in:
- Immediate termination
- Logged failure state

---

## Non-Interpretive Rule

Simulation results are not adjusted to “look right.”

If a run fails:
- The failure is preserved
- The parameters are not tuned post hoc
- The result is accepted as falsification

---

## Reproducibility Claim

If an independent party:
- Clones this repository
- Installs dependencies
- Runs the simulations as instructed

They must obtain:
- Identical metrics
- Identical plots
- Identical structural outcomes

Or the claim of reproducibility fails.
