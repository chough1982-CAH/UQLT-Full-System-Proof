# LAW_INDEX — Canonical Laws of the UQLT Full-System Proof Engine

This document enumerates the **foundational laws** governing the executable system contained in this repository.

These laws are **not optional**, **not tunable**, and **not introduced mid-simulation**.  
They are present from initialization and activate only when admissible conditions are met.

If any law is violated, the engine halts.

## Law 1 — Containment Precedence

No structure, state, or interaction may exist outside containment.

Containment is not a wall or boundary object.  
Containment is defined exclusively by the **emitted EMN field envelope** of a core.

If no containment exists, no structure may persist.

---

## Law 2 — Constraint → Saturation → Collapse

All units are constrained by a maximum admissible energy-motion capacity.

When a unit reaches saturation:
- It may not remain in its current state
- It must transition into a higher-order state
- If no legal transition exists, the system halts

Collapse is not probabilistic or optional.  
Collapse is the **only legal resolution** to saturation.

---

## Law 3 — Recursive Collapse

Collapse is scale-invariant and recursive.

A collapse event may:
- create a core
- generate a new containment
- enable further collapse events within that containment

There is no terminal scale at which collapse ceases to apply.

---

## Law 4 — No Free Propagation

Energy may not propagate freely without resistance.

All propagation incurs:
- delay
- weakening
- constraint

Unconstrained propagation is illegal and results in system failure.

---

## Law 5 — Helium Dominance Trigger

Helium-family accumulation is the primary collapse trigger.

When helium-family states dominate a local region beyond the admissible threshold:
- collapse must occur
- core formation must follow

Hydrogen and its isotopes are treated as **byproducts**, not primary fuels.

---

## Law 6 — Core Emission (EMN Law)

All cores emit energy outward.

This emitted energy:
- weakens monotonically with distance
- defines the containment envelope
- governs all downstream structure, layering, and stability

No inward-directed core emission is permitted.

---

## Law 7 — Valignity (Radial Ordering Law)

Within containment, effective density orders radially.

Higher-density states stabilize closer to the core.  
Lower-density states stabilize farther from the core.

This ordering:
- does not require gravity
- does not require attraction
- emerges from EMN field strength alone

Stable hover / neutral bands are permitted outcomes of this law.

---

## Law 8 — Surface Equilibrium

A surface forms at the radius where:
- inward EMN pressure
- outward decay / fragmentation pressure

are in equilibrium.

The surface is not imposed.  
It is an emergent balance condition.

---

## Law 9 — Internal-Only Causation

All causation within the system is internal.

No external forces, frames, or boundary conditions may be invoked to explain outcomes.

If an outcome cannot arise internally, it is invalid.

---

## Law 10 — Structural Closure

All simulations must converge to one of two outcomes:
1. A structurally closed configuration
2. A hard failure due to law violation

Open-ended or indeterminate states are not permitted.

---

## Enforcement

Each law is enforced directly in code:
- illegal states halt execution
- illegal transitions halt execution
- illegal propagation halts execution

These laws are validated by explicit tests in the `tests/` directory.
