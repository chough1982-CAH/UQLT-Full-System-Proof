# UQLT Law Index

This document enumerates the foundational laws enforced by the
Unified Quantum Life Theory (UQLT) proof engine.

These laws are not descriptive assumptions.
They are **hard constraints** enforced at runtime.

---

## Law 1 — Constraint-Only Evolution
No force, attraction, expansion, or tuning exists.
Only legal and illegal states.

---

## Law 2 — Ordered State Emergence
States must evolve strictly in this order:

VOID → STATIC → RADIO → RADIANT → PLASMA → HELIUM → CORE

Skipping stages is forbidden.

---

## Law 3 — Helium Dominance Collapse
Collapse is triggered only when helium dominance
creates an illegal continuation state.

---

## Law 4 — Collapse Is Not a Function
Collapse is not called.
It occurs because no legal alternative exists.

---

## Law 5 — EMN Emission Is an Effect
EMN emission only occurs after core formation.
It cannot initiate structure.

---

## Law 6 — Valignity Ordering
Layering, hover bands, and equilibrium arise
from density constraints, not gravity.

---

## Law 7 — Emergent Time and Rate
Time and rate emerge from collapse gradients.
No clock is defined.
